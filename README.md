# Daikatana 1.3 Project for macOS

This is the placeholder repository for the MacSourcePorts build of the [Daikatana 1.3 Project](https://bitbucket.org/daikatana13/daikatana/).

Unlike most projects on MacSourcePorts, Daikatana is not open source so we can't share the source code with you. 

Download the latest release from the Releases section to the right. When opening the app for the first time it should prompt you for the location of your Daikatana data files. It will then copy them to the Application Support folder it needs them to be in for subsequent runs. 

For a rundown of why this port is cool check this [GManLives video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7RjuOA6aD8)

***KNOWN ISSUE***: At this time, when you run the game it will prompt you to check your files. This check will fail even if you have the right files. I'm looking into it but in the meantime just skip this check, either by clicking "No Thanks" or just hitting the back arrow on the screen. 

If you have any questions email me at macsourceports@gmail.com
